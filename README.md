## üéØ Project Overview

The **Trillo** project is part of an **Advanced CSS and SASS** course, where the primary focus is building a **flexbox-based responsive UI**. The app is designed with clean, modern aesthetics, and it utilizes **SCSS** for maintainable and modular styles. While the interface is fully designed, **functionality is not implemented**‚Äîit is strictly a front-end demo.

## üåü Features

### üì± Responsive UI Design
- Fully responsive layout built using **Flexbox**, ensuring it adapts to all screen sizes.
- **SCSS** is used for scalable and modular styles, making it easy to maintain and update.
- **CSS Variables** are employed for consistent color schemes and design elements across the project.

### üñºÔ∏è Visual-Only Elements
- **Search Bar**: The search bar expands when focused, but it is non-functional and purely a design element.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Includes links for **hotels**, **flights**, **car rentals**, and **tours**‚Äîthese links do not redirect or trigger any actions.
- **Buttons**: Buttons like "Book now" and "Show all reviews" are for UI purposes only and do not execute any backend logic.

### üè® Hotel Overview
- Displays a **hotel name**, star ratings, location, and amenities list.
- **Gallery**: A simple, non-interactive image gallery that showcases hotel images.

### üë• User Reviews and Recommendations
- **User Reviews** section presents mock reviews with user names, ratings, and profile pictures. However, this is static content with no actual review functionality.
- **Recommendations**: A section where friends' recommendations are visually displayed, but there is no backend data or logic.

## üíª Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: For structured and semantic content.
- **SCSS**: For scalable and modular styling with variables, mixins, and responsive breakpoints.
- **Flexbox**: Used exclusively for layout design and responsiveness.
- **CSS Variables**: Ensuring consistent styling across components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Sections

- **User Navigation**: Includes mock notifications for bookmarks and messages, with a static profile picture.

### Sidebar

### Hotel View

- **Gallery**: Shows hotel images in a gallery format.
- **Details & Reviews**: Contains a static list of amenities and mock reviews from users.

### Reviews
- **User Reviews**: Displays sample reviews with profile pictures, but reviews are static and non-functional.

### Call to Action

## üé® Design Details

### Colors
The project uses **CSS Variables** to define and reuse colors throughout the application:
```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #eb2f64;
  --color-primary-light: #ff3366;
  --color-primary-dark: #ba265d;
  --color-grey-light-1: #faf9f9;
  --color-grey-dark-2: #777;
}
```

### Shadows and Borders
Box shadows and borders add depth and separation to the design:
```css
:root {
  --shadow-dark: 0 2rem 6rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  --line: 1px solid var(--color-grey-light-2);
}
```

### Media Queries
Custom breakpoints ensure the UI adjusts across different screen sizes:
```scss
$bp-largest: 75em;
$bp-large: 68.75em;
$bp-medium: 56.25em;
$bp-small: 37.5em;
```
